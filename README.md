# Django Unit Test starter code and functional requirements template

Use the provided starter project for this exercise.

### Development Request
Your stakeholders have requested some enhancements to their software solution 'Good Vibes'.

* Add a new web page that returns a random good vibes message to the user.

### Exercise Deliverables
* Produce a Functional Requirements Brief document in regards to the new feature(s) requested
* Add the code to return a random good vibes message from a hardcoded list of messages in views.py and render it in the template ```mod.html```
* Create a test case that tests that your route to the message of the day page is valid and returns a web page

#### Challenge:
* Add a web page that contains a form that lets users submit their own good vibes message for addition to the available messages. (hint: just add message submitted to the existing message list)
* Add a test case for the form that ensures that the form cannot be submitted with message that does not contain the text ```good vibes``` somewhere in the text.
